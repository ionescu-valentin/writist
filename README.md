The application was born from a school project that I wanted to upgrade and improve, because I saw the potential in it.
Features:
- log-in system with a database of users and password encrypting
- responsiveness - the app is optimized for mobile and the interface changes accordingly
- possibility to write articles of different types and publish them to all the users
- possibility to read articles wrote by other users and add comments
- Colorful user interface and visual effects provided by Materialize CSS 

Next steps:
- add a user profile page and encourage interaction between users
- add reactions and achievements in order to engage users into writing more
- rewrite the application using a framework like Angular or a library like React
